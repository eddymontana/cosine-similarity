# cosine-similarity
This repository presents a deep learning-powered fashion recommendation system that suggests clothing items based on their visual characteristics, moving beyond traditional tag-based recommendations


Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features
Overview
This project develops a deep learning-powered fashion recommendation system that leverages computer vision to provide personalized clothing suggestions. Unlike conventional methods, this system analyzes visual features (patterns, textures, silhouettes, colors) extracted directly from garment images, enabling more intuitive and aesthetically aligned recommendations.

Features
Visual Feature Extraction: Utilizes pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for rich image embedding.

Similarity-Based Recommendations: Recommends items based on the visual resemblance of their extracted features.

Jupyter Notebooks: Comprehensive step-by-step code for data processing, model training, and recommendation logic.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/eddymontana/cosine-similarity
cd cosine-similarity
Dataset: Place your fashion image dataset in the designated data/ directory (e.g., data/fashion_images/).

Environment Setup:

Bash

conda create -n fashion_recommender python=3.9
conda activate fashion_recommender
pip install -r requirements.txt # (You'll need to create this file)
Run Notebooks: Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory (e.g., 1_Feature_Extraction.ipynb, 2_Recommendation_Logic.ipynb).

Requirements
A requirements.txt file is coming soon, but key libraries include:

tensorflow

scikit-learn

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Pillow
